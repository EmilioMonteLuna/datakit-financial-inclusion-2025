# Challenge: Exploring International Economic Opportunity Data and Insights
DataKind aims to grow the breadth and depth of our knowledge in the financial inclusion and economic opportunity sector to support a global suite of stakeholders. Through this DataKit, we’re looking to explore international economic opportunity data and insights to better understand opportunities to leverage publicly available data to support local decision-making and impact. 

## How will this be used? 
This exploration will provide DataKind with the ability to validate the breadth and depth of data in different countries to paint a comprehensive picture of the financial and economic opportunity of communities within those markets. 

Additionally, the insights, analyses, and visualizations you will generate will inform the direction DataKind can take to continue to support stakeholders in the financial inclusion and economic opportunity sector. Specifically, the work will help identify the most impactful ways to structure and present data for diverse stakeholders.

## How to contribute

1. Download country- specific suggested datasets, as available. 
2. Research additional datasets for that country that provide information on financial inclusion and economic opportunity. Please focus on the most recently available datasets (e.g. anything from 2018 onwards). 
    1. **Financial inclusion** means that individuals and businesses have access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs. 
    2. **Economic opportunity** aims to reduce poverty, inequality, and unemployment by creating an inclusive economy where everyone has a fair chance to succeed. It can include:
        * *Job availability*: Access to employment that offers fair wages and benefits.
        * *Entrepreneurship*: Opportunities to start and grow businesses (e.g. access credit or loans).
        * *Education and skill development*: Access to training and education to enhance employability.
        * *Access to markets and financial services*: Opportunities to access capital, resources, and markets for economic growth. 
        * *Home or land ownership*: Opportunity to contribute to long-term financial security and wealth generation.
    3. Demographic data is also extremely important to paint a picture of the distribution of these key indicators by race, gender, age, and other key factors. *This should be a standard dataset included for each country below, as available.*
3. Identify the unit of analysis for each dataset (e.g individual, household, county, region). This will differ by country and how they break down geographic locations. We have proposed the unit of analysis to explore for each country below.
    1. *Do the geographies/ units of analysis for these datasets overlap?* 
    2. *If not, can the unit of analysis be transformed to compare more than one dataset?*
4. Identify the variables that are representative of or proxies for economic development and financial well-being. 

Relevant categories include, but are not limited to:

#### Financial Inclusion Indicators (Measures of Financial Well-being)
* Account Ownership (%): Percentage of adults (15+) with an account at a financial institution or mobile money provider.
* Mobile Money Usage (%): Percentage of adults using mobile money accounts for transactions.
* Savings Behavior (%): Percentage of adults who saved money in the past year (formal or informal).
* Borrowing Behavior (%): Percentage of adults who borrowed money in the past year (formal or informal)
* Credit Access (%): Percentage of adults who have access to credit through banks or microfinance institutions.
* Digital Payment Adoption (%): Percentage of adults using digital financial services (mobile money, online banking, etc.).
* Remittances Received (%): Percentage of adults receiving remittances from abroad.

#### Labor Market & Income Indicators (Proxies for Economic Development)
* Unemployment Rate (%): Proportion of the labor force that is unemployed
* Labor Force Participation Rate (%): Share of the working-age population that is either employed or actively looking for work.	
* Informal Employment (%): Share of workers employed without formal contracts or benefits.	
* Monthly Household Income: Average monthly income per household
* Wage Inequality (Gini Index): Measure of income inequality in the country
* Social Protection Coverage (%): Percentage of population covered by social protection systems (pensions, social assistance, etc.).

#### Economic Infrastructure Indicators (Enabling Environment)
* Access to Electricity (%): Percentage of households with access to electricity.
* Mobile Phone Ownership (%): Percentage of adults owning a mobile phone.
* Internet Access (%): Percentage of adults with access to the internet.
* Distance to Nearest Bank (km):	Average distance from a household to the nearest bank branch or financial access point.	
* Road Density (km per sq. km): Length of roads per square kilometer of land.	
Urban Population (%): Share of population living in urban areas.

#### Household Assets and Consumption (Proxy for Wealth/Well-being)
* Land Ownership (%): Percentage of households owning agricultural or residential land.

5. Transform data to be at the same unit of analysis, and append datasets for the selected country. 

6. Execute exploratory data analysis of the data. 
    1. *What can you learn from the data?*
    2. *Are there interesting or relevant insights you can highlight?* 
    3. *How can you visualize the data in a way that provides easily-interpretable insights for stakeholders that are at different levels of their data maturity journey?*
    4. Complete an initial review of the data structure and completeness across datasets for the selected country
        * *Which variables have the most missing data?*
        * *Is there any patterns to the missing data (e.g., concentrated in certain regions or demographics)?*
    5. Explore socio-demographic patterns	
        * *How do financial inclusion or economic opportunity indicators vary by gender? age group? education level? employment status?*
        * *Are there any clear trends? E.g. Is there a clear trend where higher education or employment increases financial inclusion?*
    6. Explore geographic distribution of the data, based on the recommended unit of analysis, as available 
        * *Is there a clear rural-urban divide in financial inclusion or economic development?*
        * *What areas have the highest/lowest rates of bank account ownership? mobile money usage? access to credit?*
    7. Assessing economic well-being 
        * *What is the distribution of household income or consumption levels?*
